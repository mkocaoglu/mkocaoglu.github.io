Our group's research is focused on developing fundamental algorithms for causal discovery and inference from data. Some threads we focus on are as follows:

# Causal Discovery from Observations
We would like to extend the limits of existing causal discovery algorithms from observational data. We establish connections with information theory and develop efficient algorithms for causal structure discovery using these connections.
