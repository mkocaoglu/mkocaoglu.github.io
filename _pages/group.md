# Projects
Our group's research is focused on developing fundamental algorithms for causal discovery and inference from data. Some threads we focus on are as follows:

## Information Theoretic Causal Discovery from Observational Data
We would like to extend the limits of the existing causal discovery algorithms from observational data. We establish connections with information theory and develop efficient algorithms for causal structure discovery using these connections.

## Causal Discovery from Interventional Data
Causal discovery from interventional data is the golden standard where we can get away with the least amount of assumptions. However one challenge today is that interventions are expensive and we need to make best use of the available interventional data. Especially for large-scale systems, learning the causal structure exhaustively requires too many experiments. We focus on distilling as much information as possible from a given collection of interventional datasets.
