Research
======
My current research focuses on machine learning in general and causal inference and learning algorithms from data in particular. Specifically, I have been developing algorithms for learning causal graphs from observational and experimental data using tools from information theory and graph theory.

<span style="color:red"> New! </span> I will be starting as an assistant professor at Purdue University in the ECE department in January 2021 and will be looking for motivated Ph.D. students to work on fundamental problems in causal inference with machine learning applications starting Fall 2021. Please apply [here](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/admissions/how-to-apply/index.html), mention my name in your application package and email me your resume at mkocaoglu - at - utexas.edu with the subject line "Prospective PhD Student" w/out the quotes.   
*If you already sent me an email, please see this [note](https://www.muratkocaoglu.com/prospective).*
