Research
======
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the ECE department. My current research focuses developing fundamental causal inference and structure discovery algorithms in order to pave the way for causal machine learning. Specifically, I have been working on learning causal graphs from observational and/or experimental data. 

News
======
<span style="color:red"> New! </span> I am looking for PhD students to start in Fall-22, who are enthusiastic and motivated to do fundamental research in causal inference, causal discovery with applications in machine learning and reinforcement learning. Students from under-represented minorities are encouraged to apply.

<span style="color:red"> New! </span> Our lab received the [Adobe Data Science Research Award](https://research.adobe.com/data-science-research-awards/) for the project _Causal Discovery for Root Cause Analysis_. 

We are organizing a AAAI Workshop on the Information-Theoretic Methods for Causal Inference and Discovery! Submit your papers at the intersection of causal inference/discovery, information theory and machine learning. See the [workshop website](https://sites.google.com/view/itci22) for more details and submission instructions. 

Our paper titled "Entropic Causal Inference: Identifiability for Trees and Complete Graphs" is accepted at the ICML-21 Workshop on Information-Theoretic Methods for Rigorous, Responsible, and Reliable Machine Learning - [ITR3](https://sites.google.com/view/itr3).
