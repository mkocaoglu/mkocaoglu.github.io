# Projects
Our group's research is focused on developing fundamental algorithms for causal discovery and inference from data. Some threads we focus on are as follows:

## *Information Theoretic Causal Discovery from Observational Data*
We would like to extend the limits of the existing causal discovery algorithms from observational data. We establish connections with information theory and develop efficient algorithms for causal structure discovery using these connections.

## *Experimental Design for Causal Discovery*
In many settings, further experimentation is possible in order to aid with causal structure discovery. We seek out methods to be as efficient as possible with these experimental designs. Efficiency can mean different things in different contexts, for example, using the smallest possible number of experiments or minimizing an arbitrary modular cost function.

## *Causal Discovery from Interventional Data*
Causal discovery from interventional data is the golden standard where we can get away with the least amount of assumptions. However one challenge today is that interventions are expensive and we need to make best use of the available interventional data. Especially for large-scale systems, learning the causal structure exhaustively requires too many experiments. We focus on distilling as much information as possible from a given collection of interventional datasets.

## *Applications of Causality in Machine Learning*
We explore where causal inference and discovery could benefit the current machine learning methods.
