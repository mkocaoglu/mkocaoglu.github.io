I am looking for prospective PhD and MS students who are enthusiastic about doing fundamental work in causality and machine learning. In order of importance, things I look for in a candidate are motivation to do good research, mathematical maturity, a strong undergrad-level background in probability theory and linear algebra, and research experience (optional). 

If you think you would be a good fit for our lab, please send me an email with your interests and CV with the subject line containing the word "Prospective". Please apply [here](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/phd-program/phd-program-admissions/).

### Postdoctoral Positions

I have open post-doctoral researcher positions in my lab. A postdoctoral researcher should have everything listed above for PhD candidates, plus have a strong publication record in NeurIPS, ICML, UAI, AAAI, and have (or soon will have) a PhD in a related field such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Math, etc.

[//]: # "If you decide to apply to Purdue ECE, make sure to indicate your interest to work with me in your application materials where it is appropriate. A detailed description of which research projects you are interested in the most would be helpful." 

[//]: # "Please note that it is impossible for me to comment on whether you should apply to Purdue to work with me or not before having access to the rest of the application pool. To help you better evaluate whether to apply to Purdue to work with me or not, the following might help. "

[//]: # "- For PhD positions in my group, a **strong undergraduate-level background in probability theory and linear algebra** is necessary. Moreover, prior research exposure and/or publications are a plus but not necessary. " 
 
 
[//]: # "- It is always a good idea to apply to graduate schools where you have multiple faculty that you can see yourself working with. You can check the current Purdue ECE faculty [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Faculty). " 

### For Undergraduates:
Our lab is open to undergraduates from related departments who would like to gain research experience. You must have taken an undergraduate probability class, and be ready to contribute consistently in the assigned project. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you satisfy these criteria. 


### Tips for post-LLM apocalypse:
Do not use LLMs to write your email for you. Keep your email short. Make sure to attach your CV and transcripts to your initial email. Bonus points if you have read and understood at least one paper from our lab. Do not use LLMs to read the said paper for you.
