I am always on the lookout for prospective PhD students who are enthusiastic about doing fundamental work in causality, machine learning, and information theory. However, due to the volume of emails I am receiving, I will not be able to respond to everyone. Thank you for understanding. 

In order of importance, things I look for in a Ph.D. candidate are motivation to do research, mathematical maturity, a strong undergrad-level background in probability theory and linear algebra, and research experience (optional).

The application to my group should be done through the official channels via Purdue graduate school application page. Make sure to indicate your interest to work with me in your application materials where it is appropriate. A detailed description of which research projects you are interested in the most would be helpful. 

Please note that it is impossible for me to comment on whether you should apply to Purdue to work with me or not before having access to the rest of the application pool. To help you better evaluate whether to apply to Purdue to work with me or not, the following might help. 

[//]: # "- For PhD positions in my group, a **strong undergraduate-level background in probability theory and linear algebra** is necessary. Moreover, prior research exposure and/or publications are a plus but not necessary. " 
 
 
[//]: # "- It is always a good idea to apply to graduate schools where you have multiple faculty that you can see yourself working with. You can check the current Purdue ECE faculty [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Faculty). " 

### For Undergraduates:
Our lab is open to Purdue undergraduates from related departments who would like to gain theoretical research experience. You must have taken ECE 302 or an equivalent undergraduate probability class, and be ready to contribute consistently in the assigned project. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you satisfy these criteria.
