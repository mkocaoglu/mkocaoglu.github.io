Due to the volume of emails I am receiving, I will not be able to respond to everyone. Thank you for understanding. To help you better evaluate whether to apply to Purdue to work with me or not, the following might help. 

- For PhD positions in my group, a strong undergraduate-level mathematical background is necessary. Moreover publications and/or research exposure is a plus. 

- It is always a good idea to apply to graduate schools where you have multiple faculty that you can see yourself working with.
